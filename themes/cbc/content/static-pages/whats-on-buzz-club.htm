<p>Each year we run a week of Buzz Club. This is a holiday club for children aged 5 to 11. A team of willing helpers from the church, along with a trained and gifted children's worker from elsewhere, spend two hours with the children each morning singing songs, teaching them Bible stories, enjoying quizzes, doing various crafts and enjoying games. It is always a great week, culminating on the Friday evening where parents are invited and prizes are given out.</p><p><span>All activities at the church are carried out in accordance with our </span><a href="http://crockenhill.org/publication_files/ChildProtection.pdf">Child Protection Policy</a><span> and our our </span><a href="http://crockenhill.org/publication_files/positive-behaviour-policy.pdf">Positive Behaviour Policy</a><span>.</span>â€‹</p>
